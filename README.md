# Project #1

In this project, our goal was to implement Relational Algebra (RA) operators. These include the select, project, minus, union, equi-join, theta-join, and natural join operators. We based the Java implementation of these operators on the pseudo-code that was lectured on in class. We also implemented a typecheck method that will check the size of a tuple and the type of its elements to ensure that it is from the correct domain.


## Key Features

- **Objective:**  
  To allow the user to do relational algebra on different tables that are inputted.

- **User Roles:**  
  Doing relational algebra on tables that you can create.

- **Key Goals:**

  -To correctly and effieciently implement different relational algebra operators for the user to use.

- **Significance:**
    - Saves the user time by doing the relational algebra computation itself.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed the latest version of Java (Java 22).


## Technologies Used

- Java 22.0.2 2024-07-16
- IntelliJ
- GitHub (version control)

## Execution

1. Download the zip folder
2. extract the folder into a project in IntelliJ
3. Ensure that the project is using JDK 22
4. To compile and run you can navigate to MovieDB2 (holds the main function) the green play button in the right hand corner and click it while ensuring that the Run config next to it is set to MovieDB2.
5. This will run the program based on the test cases in MovieDB2 and will show the output in the console.

## Contribution

This project is a collaborative effort involving a team of 5 members, including a manager.

- Jillian was the manager of the project who wrote the documentation.pdf, ManagersReport.pdf, and README.md files. She also tested the code that the programmers gave to ensure that it worked properly.
- Luke implemented the natural join and typecheck methods.
- Armaity implemented the minus and union methods.
- Ruthvik implemented the theta-join and equi-join methods.
- Nehaa implemented the select and project methods.
